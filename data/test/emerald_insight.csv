A key part of this involved the creation of two possible future environments of the NHS. These became known as “the Madingley Scenarios”. In this article, the context of this work is briefly outlined before describing the main drivers that are shaping this environment (technology and information, new power structures, the changing relat ion ship with the living environment, and the effect of social and cultural change). The scenarios themselves are then outlined followed by some reflections on the value of this work in healthcare and beyond.;National Health Service, Scenario planning, Forward scheduling;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5

Olson (Institute for Alternative Futures, 100 N Pitt Street, Suite 235, Alexandria, VA 22314, USA);The end of the Cold War, the proliferation of “troubled states” and the rise of new kinds of transnational problems is forcing the USA and others to reappraise the nature of national security. This article explores the role of the US military in responding to these new challenges, specifically focusing on military operations other than war (OOTW), ie deterring war, resolving conflict, peacekeeping, nation building, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. Through a consideration of driving forces and the construction of four scenarios (Turbulent Third Wave, The Dark Side, Global Mind Change and Technology Transformation), the article highlights key findings. Across all scenarios, demand for involvement in OOTW was found to increase substantially between now and 2020.;Armed forces, Conflict, USA;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5

Abeles (Sacacity, Inc, 3704 11th Ave. South, Minneapolis, MN 55407, USA);Scholars have wandered the earth seeking community and resources for practising their art. It has only been for the last 500 years that universities have provided such a cloistered environment. A confluence of circumstances has broken this intellectual hegemony, threatening the sinecure, and forcing the institutions and the academics, themselves, to confront a past that never was while building towards a future that never will be.;Students, Academic staff, Business education;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5

In similar ways, our own time was seen as marked by such advances by futurists of earlier decades. But at the end of the twentieth century, resistance to the claims of mainstream science and technology has grown to an extent unanticipated in these earlier appraisals. This essay argues that such resistance is liable to flourish in the twenty?first century, and that understanding why this should be the case is important for studies of the future. In particular, this essay takes up the Fortean approach. This approach examines areas of human experience that are “damned” by mainstream science, and also examines the processes and strategies adopted both by those effecting the damnation, and those challenging it. The case being made is that although we can expect many of these damned phenomena to remain excluded – deservedly so in some cases – this will not always be the case.;Science, Technology, Process innovation;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5

This will affect the way we view economic growth and how the benefits of it are used. There will be much greater concern about the quality of time use, and about the way our lives are divided between free time and paid work. Using the example of the UK, this article highlights the reasons why the conventional view of the future is not sustainable, and discusses the actions needed if the required transformation of the future is to be achieved.;Economic growth, Time management, Leisure;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5

Madu (Professor and Chair, Management Science Program at the Lubin School of Business, Pace University, 1 Pace Plaza, New York, NY 10038, USA);In this article, we discuss the role of the internet in cultural changes and transformation. The traditional view is that inherent cultures affect business operations so corporations must be cognizant of the prevalent cultures in their operating environments. Frequently, failures of multinational corporations in new environments are often blamed on corporate lack of knowledge and understanding of these prevalent cultures. While this may still be true in today’s environment, the influence of technology, particularly the internet in the 21st century, has been so significant that the world may be approaching a “unification of cultures”. Thus, this paper argues that the internet will lead to a global cultural transformation that will enhance global business operations by removing cultural barriers that lead to sub?optimal business operations.;National cultures, Globalization, Technology;MCB UP Ltd;Published: 1999, Start page: 5
